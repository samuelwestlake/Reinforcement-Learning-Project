# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
Implementation of a Nearest Sequence Memory (NSM) algorithm applied to a partially observable version of McCallum's grid-world.

Episodes are simulated for both an agent taking random actions, and an agent implementing NSM.  
Summaries for each agent are plotted after completion.
